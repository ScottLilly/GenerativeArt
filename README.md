# GenerativeArt

Build images from random or randomish values. This currently draws rectangles and circles of random sizes, colors, and orientations. It draws a tiled set of connected lines, with randomly colored circles in the middle, and connected lines 

In the future, I'd like it to draw images based on values from things like weather data, stock market data, etc.
